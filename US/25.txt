Japan has the highest ratio of elderly people relative to working-age people globally
Demographers define the “old-age dependency ratio” as the number of people older than 64, relative to the number of working-age people.

It’s in Japan that this ratio is the highest in the world. As the chart shows, it surpassed 50% in 2021. This means there are only two working-age people for every elderly person in Japan.

Italy and Finland come next, with 37% — closer to three working-age people for every elderly person. The global figure is 15% — a ratio of 1 to 6.

The world is aging overall, and some countries are aging much more rapidly than others.
